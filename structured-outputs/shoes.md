### CloudStrider Sneakers

1. Stars: 2  
   "The shoes were super comfortable initially, but after just two months, the sole started to peel off! Really disappointed with the durability."  
2. Stars: 1  
   "I ordered my usual size, but these sneakers were way too tight. Had to return them. The sizing is totally off."  
3. Stars: 3  
   "Great for short runs, but they hold onto odors even after washing. Not ideal for heavy use."  
4. Stars: 5  
   "Extremely lightweight and breathable. Perfect for casual jogging. No issues so far!"

### PeakTrek Hikers

1. Stars: 1  
   "These boots claim to be waterproof, but my feet were soaked after just walking through damp grass. Not worth it."  
2. Stars: 2  
   "I slipped multiple times on rocky trails because the soles don’t grip well on wet surfaces. Not safe for serious hikes."  
3. Stars: 4  
   "The boots are sturdy and provide decent ankle support, but I wish the padding was thicker for longer treks."  
4. Stars: 5  
   "Used these for a weekend hike in the mountains, and they held up really well. No blisters, and they felt solid."

### SwiftShine Heels

1. Stars: 2  
   "I wore these to a wedding, and the heel broke during the reception. Embarrassing and frustrating!"  
2. Stars: 3  
   "While they look stunning, the glossy finish scratches so easily. They were scuffed after just one night out."  
3. Stars: 1  
   "The worst! My feet were in so much pain after an hour. Definitely not designed for comfort."  
4. Stars: 4  
   "Beautiful shoes, and I received so many compliments. Just don’t wear them if you’ll be on your feet all day."

### LuxeLace Oxfords

1. Stars: 5  
   "These oxfords are absolutely perfect for office wear. The leather feels premium, and they’ve held up beautifully after months of use."  
2. Stars: 4  
   "Stylish and comfortable, but I wish they came in more color options. A great buy overall!"  
3. Stars: 5  
   "Finally found dress shoes that don’t kill my feet after a full day at work. Great craftsmanship!"  
4. Stars: 4  
   "They’re a bit stiff out of the box, but after breaking them in, they’re incredibly comfortable and classy."

### EcoStep Slip-Ons

1. Stars: 5  
   "Love these slip-ons! They’re so easy to wear, and the fact that they’re made from recycled materials is a huge plus."  
2. Stars: 4

   "These have quickly become my go-to everyday shoes. Lightweight, breathable, and eco-friendly!"  
4. Stars: 4  
   "The fit is great, and I appreciate the sustainable design. They could use a bit more arch support, but otherwise fantastic."

### BounceMax Runners

   "These runners are a dream for long-distance running. The cushioning is excellent, and my feet feel great even after 10 miles!"  
2. Stars: 5  
   "Absolutely love these! They provide just the right amount of support and bounce for my workouts."  
3. Stars: 4  
   "Great performance shoes. Only minor complaint is that they’re slightly bulkier than expected, but it’s a small tradeoff for the comfort."  
4. Stars: 5  
   "I’ve tried many running shoes, and these are by far the best. Durable, comfortable, and stylish too."
