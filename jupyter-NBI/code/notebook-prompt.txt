Create a new pandas dataframe with the following data:'HadCRUT-global-monthly.csv'
The dataframe contains the following columns: 'Time', 'Anomaly (deg C)', 'Uncertainty (deg C)', 'Lower bound (deg C)', 'Upper bound (deg C)'.
The column 'Time' that contains a date in YYYY-MM format. Split this into two columns, one for years and one for months.
Create a new dataframe that uses the data from the current one. 
The new dataframe should have columns for each of the months and rows for each year. 
The cells should contain the 'Anomaly (deg C)' values.
Create a new column in the new dataframe for the summer temperature that is the average of the months 06, 07, and 08 (i.e. June, July and August).
Draw a Plotly Express bar chart of summer temperatures over each year.
Use the plotly_white template, change the size to 800 x 600 and use the 'inferno' color scheme.
Turn the x-axis labels 45 degrees and only show a label for every 10th year.
